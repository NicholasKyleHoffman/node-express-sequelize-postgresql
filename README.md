Thank you so much for these tutorials, bezkoder! I am a newbie in fullstack, but I followed this guide for back-end and this (https://github.com/bezkoder/react-crud-web-api) for front-end. Everything is working great on localhost.

However, when I try to access the site from local area network or internet, the back-end connection does not seem to work due to CORS. My web browser console prints this error:

Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://localhost:8080/api/tutorials. (Reason: CORS request did not succeed).

I have looked through hours of different tutorials, but I still seem to get the same error. Could you please help me? ðŸ™‚"

Hi, just comment (disable) this line:"

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
